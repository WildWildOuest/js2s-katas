Javascript to Typescript katas

## Goal

This repository is an attempt to rewrite some old Javascript katas I used to train on with Typescript.
This is purely educational and a mean to help me progress, but feel free to contribute if you want to.

## Katas

1. Fibonacci
2. FizzBuzz
3. Anagrams  
4. Valid parentheses
